Text Summarization with Python and NetworkX
===========
This Python script utilizes the NLTK library along with NetworkX to perform text summarization using the TextRank algorithm. Text summarization is the process of distilling the most important information from a source text while preserving its key ideas and meaning. The TextRank algorithm applies graph-based ranking to determine the significance of sentences within the text, allowing for the creation of concise summaries.

Features
=========
+ **Tokenization:** The text is tokenized into sentences and words using NLTK's sent_tokenize and word_tokenize functions.
+ **Stopword Removal:** Common English stopwords are removed to focus on meaningful content.
+ **Word Frequency Calculation:** The frequency of each word is calculated using NLTK's FreqDist, aiding in identifying important keywords.
+ **Graph Representation:** Sentences are represented as nodes in a graph, with edges connecting sentences sharing common words.
+ **TextRank Algorithm:** The PageRank algorithm from NetworkX is applied to rank the sentences based on their importance in the text.
+ **Summary Generation:** The top-ranked sentences are selected to form a coherent summary of the original text.

Usage
=======
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the text_summarization.py script with Python, providing your text input within the script or via a file.
